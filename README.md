YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis

### Steps followed:
### STEP 1: Scraping Comments:
###### Scraping comments from a particular sidemen youtube video. 
###### One drawback: was not able to take very popular vids with comments > 60000 as then it would take the google script to execute for more than 6 minutes which automatically terminates it.
###### Firstly without replies & secondly with replies.
###### Add youtube data API v3 under services in new editor and under resources in old editor.
###### Run the .gs code to extract comment out of video on to the google sheet.
###### Verify the order of comments from the youtube video after sorting it by newest first.
###### Download the google sheet as .csv & transfer it on your google drive.

### STEP 2: Mounting the google drive on the google colab & continuing with the extracted dataset further.
